Inspired by this old Freddie Wong video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4ihwfQipfo

In this game you are surrounded by ticking alarm clocks which are set to activate at random times.  As the round progresses, the time between clock activations becomes shorter and shorter, until all clocks have been activated.  The round ends after all clocks have been shot.
Points are earned only when an alarm clock is shot while it is activated/ringing.  The amount of points awarded per clock quickly diminishes after that clock begins ringing.  Any shots which do not hit an active/ringing clock will award no points and reset the score multiplier. Shooting a ticking clock too early will automatically deactivate that clock.  Thus, in order to maximize your score, you must react quickly when a clock begins ringing as well as accurately aim your shots to maintain your score multiplier.
